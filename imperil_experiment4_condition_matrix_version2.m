%% Imperil or Protect 4 - Condition Matrix Generator (v2)
% Coded by A.Y.

% Conception: 16.09.2025

%% As of 16.09.2025, the experimental design has been revised. 

% In this latest version, we have two factors (repetition: 1st vs. 5th) &
% context change (no change, change). We will present each image in
% repetition series of six trials. No single-trial series in between them.
% 720 trials in total, although we may consider lowering the total for a
% shorter session duration. 

%% As of 20.09.2025, this code has been finalized and its content will be used as
% condition files for imperil4. 

%% 24.09.2025: The total trial count was decreased from 720 to 480, leaving 40 trials
% per condition instead of 60. The code is updated accordingly. 

%% 26.09.2025: Final adjustments before the pilot testing done. 
% Made the code more soft-coded. 

desiredTrialCount = 480; % Can change to 720
computerHandle = 1; % 0 for ali's pc, 1 for the experiment comp

if computerHandle == 0 
    condDest = '/Users/ali/Desktop/visual imperil project/imperil4materials/imperil4ConditionFiles';
elseif computerHandle == 1
    condDest = 'C:\Users\eeglab1\Desktop\Ali YÄ±lmaztekin\imperil4materials\imperil4ConditionFiles';
end

% Total number of repetition series to generate based on desired trial
% count. 720 total -> 120 series, 480 trials -> 80 series
% But always add 10 to the nSeries. The extra 10 rep series is for the training.

if desiredTrialCount == 720
    nSeries = 130;
elseif desiredTrialCount == 480
    nSeries = 90;

    % Next up, move on to the color degrees:
    % Here's the general strategy:
    % For each repetition series, first randomly pick a hue for the primary
    % image. The primary image will repeat with the same color through all six
    % trials. The secondary images will change color in on each repetition
    % though. 
    % Therefore, for the first rep, select a color degree at least 40 degrees
    % away from the primary color degree for the second image. 
    % On every next iteration, compare the color of the secondary image to the
    % previous secondary image as well as the primary image.
