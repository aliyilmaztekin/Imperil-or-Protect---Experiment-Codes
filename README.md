"Imperil or Protect" is the internal codename for the set of experiments I conducted as my master's thesis. 

The official title is "Memory in Focus: Unveiling the Impact of Reactivation on Memory Vulnerability". 

The main aim of the project was to see whether delay-period interference hurts memory performance for repeatedly studied images that were brought back to an active state in working memory following a change in the context associated with the item. 

Here, you can access various MATLAB and R codes I wrote over the years to run and analyse the study. 
Note that the general reability and quality of the coding gets better across experiments (thankfully).

The folder "common materials" contains the stimulus pool and the color wheel code/functions used in all experiments (courtesy of Tim Brady's UCSD Vision and Memory Lab: https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/resources.html).
